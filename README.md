# Start Page
I wanted to create my own start page / new tab page for when I'm on a desktop browser. It has quick links to some of my most visited websites, along with a local weather forecast powered by the OpenWeather API. I also wanted a quick search bar that redirected me to a google search of whatever was typed in the bar. 

# Technologies Used
